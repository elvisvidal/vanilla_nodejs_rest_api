# Vanilla Node.js REST api
Creating a simple REST api with only Node.js (no Express)

## Setup
To get the project up and running you gonna need:
1) Install node.js https://nodejs.org/en/. I'm currently running it on node version: v14.16.0 npm version: 7.6.0.
2) Run `npm install` to install all dependencies.
3) Run `npm run dev` to run the application localhost:5000 with `nodemon`.
4) Run `npm run start` to run the application localhost:5000.
